I installed FreeBASIC which is a compiler for BASIC.

In order to install it I just went to http://www.freebasic.net/ and
installed it to my desktop because if you install it to the file directory they specify
it requires you to run everything as administrative.

After that I wrote a BASIC file and then ran the open-console.exe and ran the commands:

fbc.exe examples\TestForProject.bas
example\TestForProject.exe

This runs the project.
